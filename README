Learned much from doing this exercise.

First, that set operations on ints are probably best done on bit-fields, instead of arrays of int values.

Second, that the constraints are applied between two intersecting sets of int values.

I will probably scrap this and restart.

Sadly, I didn't refactor at all during this exercise, so it isn't TDD. #TDDFail.

Ah well.
